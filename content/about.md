Stuff I think about which I want to have written down for posterity to appreciate the heights of my intellect etc.

I started this after getting my own domain, mainly to have [ahiru.pl](https://ahiru.pl) actually resolve to something.

There isn't a specific topic that I focus on - I write about whatever I've been thinking about lately, but also use it
as a place to collect [notes](https://ahiru.pl/posts/blog-posts/), [anki](https://ahiru.pl/posts/rosliny/)
[collections](https://ahiru.pl/posts/ptaki/) and other such stuff. My current interests are AI safety, Anime, Biology,
Books, Botany, Programming and Rationalty, in alphabetical order.

I can be contacted via email: `me` at this domain.
