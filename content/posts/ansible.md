This blog seems to be turning into a bad and very verbose [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) wannabe. The initial idea was more of a description of what was configured etc. but it's starting to turn into a tutorial how to make something like a [freedom box](https://freedombox.org/). Pitty I didn't know about that earlier... Anyhoo - it would probably be a good idea to just make a ansible playbook describing how to provision everything, rather than writing it all out step by step.
