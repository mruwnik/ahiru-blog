Lately I've been thinking about various ways of convincing people. Or rather how different subpopulations have different ways of doing it. And how it's hard to even notice what it looks like in ones own group, while it's patently obvious when someone from a different group is doing it. There are ways of presenting an argument which are annoyingly convincing to me, while others that are ludicrously not so. Totally irrelevant to what the merits of the argument are. This, of course, results in 2 basic failure modes:
 * Something false is presented in a way that will convince me to believe in it
 * Something true is presented in a way that will cause me to not believe in it - or even stop believing, which is doubly troubling

# Groups

## Rationalistic people
*[Epistemic status](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/epistemic-status/): musings*

This is the style that I'm most prone to (both produce and accept). I'm by no means claiming that this style is inherently more [rational](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality) than others. Just that it tends to be correlated with people who actively strive to be rational. Preferably using long or archaic words, but by no means in a pretentious way. With attempts to quantify [confidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TQW9brvXJ5Fajorr4/p/GrtbTAPfkJa4D6jjH) (or lack of), along with disclaimers that honestly acknowledge any shortcomings in the arguments presented. Of course any claims must be backed up with references to [studies](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/BQBqPowfxjvoee8jw/p/ythFNoiAotjvuEGkg) that back them up, which should have tables, graphs and numbers in general. Appeals to [emotion](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/) are generally frowned upon, unless they are backed up with [data](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/11/acc-is-eating-meat-a-net-harm/) (I actually really recommend that link - it significantly updated by beliefs about eating meat). Good examples of this kind of thing are [TalkOrigins](http://talkorigins.org/origins/faqs.html), or the general [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) sphere of [rationalists](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/).

The funny thing about people from this group (or at least me) is that though they honestly and truly want to believe true things and reject false things, although they strive to do so and pride themselves on doing it, they're (or at least I am) just as easily fooled as anyone else, just by different means. I suppose it comes out as a net positive, as there are fewer bad arguments dressed up like this, though the ones that do slip through can be insidious. Especially since this group really does tend to be more rational, if by rational is understood objective data rather than subjective feelings. I.e. the more intelligent you are, the better your rationalizations.
