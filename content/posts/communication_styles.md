Lately I've been thinking about various ways of convincing people. Or rather how different subpopulations have different ways of doing it. And how it's hard to even notice what it looks like in ones own group, while it's patently obvious when someone from a different group is doing it. There are ways of presenting an argument which are annoyingly convincing to me, while others that are ludicrously not so. Totally irrelevant to what the merits of the argument are. This, of course, results in 2 basic failure modes:
 * Something false is presented in a way that will convince me to believe in it
 * Something true is presented in a way that will cause me to not believe in it - or even stop believing, which is doubly troubling

# Groups

These are some kinds of talking styles that I see the most in my circles. They are caricatures of their members, with appropriately offensive titles.

## Yudkowskyites
*[Epistemic status](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/epistemic-status/): musings*

This is the style that I'm most prone to (both produce and accept). I'm by no means claiming that this style is inherently more [rational](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality) than others. Just that it tends to be correlated with people who actively strive to be rational. Preferably using long or archaic words, but by no means in a pretentious way. With attempts to quantify [confidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/TQW9brvXJ5Fajorr4/p/GrtbTAPfkJa4D6jjH) (or lack of), along with disclaimers that honestly acknowledge any shortcomings in the arguments presented. Of course any claims must be backed up with references to [studies](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/BQBqPowfxjvoee8jw/p/ythFNoiAotjvuEGkg) that back them up, which should have tables, graphs and numbers in general. Appeals to [emotion](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/) are generally frowned upon, unless they are backed up with [data](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/11/acc-is-eating-meat-a-net-harm/) (I actually really recommend that link - it significantly updated by beliefs about eating meat). Good examples of this kind of thing are [TalkOrigins](http://talkorigins.org/origins/faqs.html), or the general [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) sphere of [rationalists](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/).

The funny thing about people from this group (or at least me) is that though they honestly and truly want to believe true things and reject false things, although they strive to do so and pride themselves on doing it, they're (or at least I am) just as easily fooled as anyone else, just by different means. I suppose it comes out as a net positive, as there are fewer bad arguments dressed up like this, though the ones that do slip through can be insidious. Especially since this group really does tend to be more rational, if by rational is understood objective data rather than subjective feelings. I.e. the more intelligent you are, the better your rationalizations.

## Fundementalist christians of the baptist adjacent persuasion

These people value individual thought, fact checking and in general following the example of the Bereans [Acts 17:11-21](https://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm). There is a very flattering assumption that their interlocutor is an intelligent person, well on their journey with the LORD. That you're well versed in scripture, but also in general doctrine, along with church history etc. They tend to know the scriptures [2 Tim. 3:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203%3A16-17&version=NIV), [Rom. 10:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010%3A17&version=NIV) and can quote verses to prove most points [Heb 4:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A12&version=NIV). Often the quoting isn't even explicit, they assume that everyone listening knows that all scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness. This, of course, can be harder for someone not well versed (hehe) in these matters, as they either only see a reflection as in a mirror of what is being said, or the conversation has to be continuously paused to add context.

  They're often very accepting of people, while at the same time very non accepting of false doctrine. This means that they'll invite you to dinner, go on a walk with you or whatever, but then will argue with you about the finer points of whether hyper-calvinism is the only true way. After which, if you still don't agree with them, there are no hard feelings. You're going to hell, but there's nothing more they can do about it, so it's not a problem. This (as should be obvious) is my favorite kind of believer - they're sincere in their beliefs, practice what they preach and tend to only preach when you'll willing to listen. They also tend to be well grounded in what they believe and are willing to actually discuss things, rather than just exchange words. My main disagreement with them is the basis of their convictions - they have a different set of base beliefs that I do, from which stem pretty much all our differences. To which they'll readily agree cheerfully. They'll tell you what they think you're doing wrong, let you know where they stand on various issues, listen to what you have to say about it, then drop the topic once no more progress is to be expected. They also often have good whiskey :D

  Here the main failure point is the reliance on Sola Scriptura. There is one source of truth which you have to accept before proceeding. Everything else is built on that. This can lead to giant edifices of circular reasoning. Especially since they tend to value individual thought - each person has to come up with their own model of life, the universe and everything. Of course there are all kinds of ready packages (e.g. Calvinist, Darby etc.), which then get freely modified by the person (or more often - their preacher/pastor/whatever). This muddles the water even further, as it doesn't suffice to find out whether they're Arminian, you have to find out what flavour and whether they even know what the term means.

  There's also the issue of the Bible being the Big Book of Multiple Choices. You can find verses that are both for and against most topics (free will? Grace vs works? Predestination? Women preachers?). Even more so when it comes to issues not explicitly mentioned (or known) - then you have to start inferring, which can lead to multiple interesting conclusions. Hence the exhortations to avoid pointless discussions [1 Tim 1:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1%3A3-4&version=NIV), [Eph 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A6&version=NIV) .

## Penties




## Tin foilers

Have you ever noticed how the mass media, establishment and those in power continuously keep certain information hidden? For example, when writing this I decided to read up on Ivermectin, which has been claimed by many COVID survivors as the key to their return to health. Naturally I wanted to learn more about this, as the truth is something very important to me. So I started to trawl the internet for information. I knew about it from [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-more-than-you-wanted), which had a deep dive into the science behind it. So I assume that it should be quite simple to read up on it. Much to my (in hindsight stupid) surprise, I couldn't find anything other than hit pieces calling it horse dewormer and such, even though it's been used for humans for ages. So this got me wondering why they were so quick to hide the truth. Why? What's in it for them? Everyone knows that the media is in the pockets of Big Pharma, so it's no surprise when they lie about safe and successful methods of fighting the virus, but in this case it doesn't seem to fit. Why would Big Pharma want to hide Ivermectin? There are 2 possibilities: they expect to get more power and money from some other way (this, of course, points a gigantic finger at the vaxx) or some other organisation, which is even more powerful than them is pressuring the media to lie. I'm by no means a crackpot, but it makes you think that the anti-vaxxers have a point in this case - not that vaccinations per se are evil - they got rid of smallpox and polio - but that the way the coronavirus vaccinations were rolled out is suspicious. Why did they hurry it so much? Why are they now trying to make them mandatory? All I want to know is the truth.

The problem with the above is mainly sloppy arguments, not necessarily intentionally. I'd even go so far as to say that in general totally sincerely. When talking with these kinds of people, they'll often update their beliefs when an error is pointed out. Which suggests that they simply didn't think all that rigorously through all the implications, or didn't have access to all the information. Which in the case of many such conspiracy theories is totally understandable - most topics which I discuss (e.g. evolution or vaccinations) are complex topics which require a wide background to understand properly. In so far as I'm in any way qualified to discuss them, it's because I spent a lot of time reading about those things. The main issue, I would say, is that they spend too much time in [soldier mindset](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-scout-mindset), where they focus on defending what they believe, rather than checking whether it's true. They also tend to accept a certain set of authorities, to whom they outsource their thinking (of which I'm also totally guilty...). That and how hard it is to navigate a world that is continuously getting more complicated
