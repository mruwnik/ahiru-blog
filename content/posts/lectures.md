As a part of my ongoing quest for excellence, world domination etc., I've lately been educating myself on various critical topics, e.g. that ancient islanders lived in [turtle shells](https://sententiaeantiquae.com/2022/01/09/turtle-eaters-and-their-homes-2/), a morsel of information which, as anyone with an ounce of reason will readily assert, is of the utmost importance to a person aspiring to the peaks of wisdom. A part of these educational endeavors is to go through a bunch of lectures on various topics. Most of them are saved as bookmarks on my home PC, which while fine for day to day activities, somewhat limits my scholastic improvements - it's hard to access data from my home computer when it's turned off... A simple solution would be to use any one of a million ways to save playlists (the most common solution of course being a Youtube profile), but I have an unnatural abhorrence of losing my [precious brainly info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNJ4Q9jqL8A). So rather than letting some internet scum steal my info, I decided to put it in one place so they can readily access it...
  Anyways - below is a list of lectures that I'm watching/planning on watching. It'll be interesting to see how many of these stay up over the years.
